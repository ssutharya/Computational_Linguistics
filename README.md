# Computational_Linguistics

1. write a python program that reads a para and:    
    a. tokenizes the text into words;  
    b. removes punctuations and converts all words to lowercase;  
    c. performs stemming and lemmatization.

2. Extract digits, Phone number, and email id from give sentence.

3. Implement simple rule based tokenizer for the English language, using regular expressions. The tokenizer should consider punctuations and special symbols as separate tokens. contractions like 'isn't' should be regarded as two tokens: is and n't, also identify abbreviations(eg: USA) and internal hyphenation (ice-cream) as single tokens

4. Implement a text classifier for sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes Theorem

5. Perform POS Tagging for an Indian lang (hindi since malayalam is too tough) using a pretrained model or dataset.   
Task:
    - Load a small set of sentences in the target lang.
    - Use libraries such as Stanza(?), IndiaNLP, or NLTK to tag parts of speech.
    - Identify common tag types and compare with english tags.
    - Discuss the challenges of POS tagging in morphologically rich lang.
